#Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Alexa Reviews
Project Overview
This project involves performing sentiment analysis on Amazon Alexa reviews. The goal is to classify customer reviews based on their sentiment, such as positive, negative, or neutral. The dataset used in this project contains reviews for Amazon Alexa, and the sentiment analysis is performed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Amazon reviews on the Alexa product. The dataset contains various attributes such as review text, rating, and sentiment. The file used for analysis is:

File Name: amazon_alexa.tsv
File Type: Tab-separated values (TSV)
Columns:
Review: The review text written by the customer.
Rating: The rating given by the customer (typically between 1 and 5).
Sentiment: The sentiment label assigned to the review (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
The dataset is located in the Data/ folder.

Tools & Technologies
Python: The primary programming language used for this analysis.
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and loading.
nltk: For text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
matplotlib / seaborn: For data visualization.
xgboost: For training the machine learning model (if used).
Steps Involved
Data Loading: Load the dataset and explore its structure.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean the text data by removing noise, stopwords, and punctuation.
Perform tokenization and vectorization to convert text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
Sentiment Analysis:
Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to classify reviews based on sentiment.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization:
Visualize the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.
Display model performance and analysis results.
Installation Instructions
To get started, follow these steps:

Clone the repository (if using version control):

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd Sentiment-Analysis
Install the required dependencies: You can install the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook: You can run the analysis in Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
Example Output
The sentiment analysis model will classify reviews into the following categories:

Positive: Reviews with a high rating (typically 4 or 5).
Negative: Reviews with a low rating (typically 1 or 2).
Neutral: Reviews with a rating of 3.
The output includes:

A classification of each review's sentiment.
Performance metrics for the model (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Visualizations of sentiment distributions.
Usage
To run the sentiment analysis on the dataset, follow these steps:

Make sure the amazon_alexa.tsv file is placed in the Data/ folder.
Run the provided Jupyter notebook (Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) which contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing, and training the model.
Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.
